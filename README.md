ExpressJS. The API also handles 404 and 500 errors and has integration tests
that cover happy and unhappy scenarios.

# Preparation of the development environment

To be able to run this server, the only thing you have to install yourself
is NodeJS. If you still don't have it installed, go ahead and download it from
this website https://nodejs.org/. The version it was last tested is `12.16.3`.

Once NodeJS is installed, navigate to a folder containing this source code and
run the command:
```
$ npm install
```

With that, you should be able to run the application and also run the test
suite by following the steps below.


# Running the application

`nodemon` is used to host the application in development mode. Nodemon ensures
that the server is restarted when source code changes, which is really handy.

To start the application in development mode, run:
```
$ npm start
```

Server will listen for requests on port 3000 (easy access - http://localhost:3000).


# Running tests

`jest` and `supertest` are the tools chosen for unit/integration testing.

> **NOTE:** Test suite will run in an independent process and **DO NOT**
> require the development server to be running at the same time.

To run the tests:
```
$ npm test
```
